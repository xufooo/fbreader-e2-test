This is very short description of FBReader build procedure.

1. Compiler.

All version of FBReader are configured for building on linux desktop
computer. You need gcc compiler for building desktop version or cross
gcc compiler for building package for another platform.

2. Libraries.

FBReader requires
  ** expat -- library for XML parsing. AFAIK, all popular destributions
     includes package with name like 'expat-dev' or 'libexpat-dev'.
     If you cannot find expat in your distribution, please visit
     http://expat.sourceforge.net
  ** enca -- encoding detection library (http://trific.ath.cx/software/enca/)
  ** UI library -- this depends on your target platform. For desktop,
       Qt library, version >= 3.0
     OR
       GTK+ library, version >= 2.4 
     should be installed.

3. How to configure.

Before building FBReader, you should check (and may be edit) 2 files:
  ** makefiles/target.mk
     In this file you should define 3 variables:
       TARGET_ARCH -- target platform for building FBReader
       UI_TYPE -- UI library
       TARGET_STATUS -- "release", "debug" or "profile". "release" is
         reasonable choice for almost all users.

     Possible pairs for TARGET_ARCH + UI_TYPE are:
        TARGET_ARCH = desktop               UI_TYPE = gtk
        TARGET_ARCH = desktop               UI_TYPE = qt
        TARGET_ARCH = zaurus                UI_TYPE = qtopia
        TARGET_ARCH = openzaurus            UI_TYPE = opie
        TARGET_ARCH = openzaurus            UI_TYPE = gpe
        TARGET_ARCH = pdaxrom-1.1.0rc10     UI_TYPE = gtk
        TARGET_ARCH = pdaxrom-1.1.0rc10     UI_TYPE = qt
        TARGET_ARCH = pdaxrom-1.1.0rc11     UI_TYPE = gtk
        TARGET_ARCH = pdaxrom-1.1.0rc11     UI_TYPE = qt
        TARGET_ARCH = opensimpad-0.9.0      UI_TYPE = opie
        TARGET_ARCH = maemo                 UI_TYPE = maemo
        TARGET_ARCH = maemo                 UI_TYPE = maemo2
        TARGET_ARCH = pma400                UI_TYPE = qtopia

  ** makefiles/arch/$(TARGET_ARCH).mk
     This file defines compiler name and location, headers and libraries
     locations, compilation flags, installation path (for desktop), etc.

4. How to build.

Just type 'make' in FBReader root directory. (FBReader root directory ==
directory containing this file.)

5. How to install.

If you want to install FBReader on your desktop computer, just run 'make install'
as root in FBReader root directory.

If you want to create package for another platform, run 'make package' in
FBReader root directory.
